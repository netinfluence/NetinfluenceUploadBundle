## File upload workflow

The whole bundle workflow can be summarised as this:

 * user is presented with a javascript upload input
 * when picking one or many files, those are sent to the server via AJAX
 * files are validated using rules from bundle config
 * if successful, they are stored in the `sandbox` filesystem
 * some data is sent back and placed in the form
 * when the form is finally submitted and valid, you will receive `FormFile` objects
 * you can now handle those yourself
